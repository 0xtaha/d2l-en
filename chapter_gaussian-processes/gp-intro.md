# Introduction to Gaussian processes

Understanding Gaussian processes (GPs) is important for reasoning about model construction and generalization, and for achieving state-of-the-art performance in a variety of applications, including active learning, and hyperparameter tuning in deep learning. GPs are everywhere, and it is in our interests to know what they are and how we can use them. 

## Definition

A Gaussian processes is defined as a collection of random variables, any finite number of which have a joint Gaussian distribution.
