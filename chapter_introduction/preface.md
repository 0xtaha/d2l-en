# Preface

In the summer of 2004 when I graduated from high school, I went to visit the ACM-ICPC (ACM International College Student Programming Competition) team of Shanghai Jiaotong University, which I was about to join. Because I only had a month of programming experience, I also only happened to be qualified for the pre-selection competition. The team leader, Mr. Yu Yong gave me a book, "Introduction to Algorithms" before I left and asked me to read it. After school started, he asked me how the reading was. I was proud to answer that I felt that it quite easy since I finished reading it in less than a month. In fact, I wasn't completely bragging as I already participated in a math contest in high school. After I got used to handling rather difficult math problems, I felt like I could understand when reading the algorithm questions that were based on a simpler logic.  Mr. Yu was very surprised: Well, I suppose you can participate in an internal competition of the team.

Actually, understanding an algorithm is only the first step. It is difficult to implement it correctly in a short period of time without a lot of practice. This is very different from mathematics. This is because the main difficulty of mathematics lies in solving problems, it is much easier to write down the solutions. Therefore, for a long time, I played last in the team internal competition. Although I understood the algorithm, I always failed to resolve code exceptions.

In the summer of 2006, I entered Mr. Lv Baoliang's Laboratory. The focus of research was to identify thinking signals from human brain waves by machine learning. I started by studying "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" and "Statistical Learning Foundation" on my own. I was deeply fascinated by these two books, and for a long time, I was so obsessed with repeatedly deducing the formulas in the book. Later, I was fascinated by reading various papers. As a result, I only felt that my theory was sufficient, and I could start experiments for writing papers when I graduated from college in 2008.  It was a pity that even if there were many ideas and theories, I could not get the desired model accuracy until two years later, when I got it right and understood how to do the experiments.

I learned an important point from these experiences: computer science is a hands-on subject, and it is difficult to achieve good results without enough hands-on ability. If the algorithm's ability corresponds to the memory size of a machine, hands-on ability is like the working frequency of the machine's CPU. Memory determines the complexity of the program that can be run, and the CPU determines how fast you can complete it. Of course, you need both of these.

After learning this lesson, the Ph.D. stage later seemed to go more smoothly. In order to study machine learning algorithms that can effectively process a large number of training samples, I chose distributed systems as one of my doctoral research directions. In order to better understand deep learning, I participated in the development of the Apache MXNet project. A lot of practice not only guaranteed stable output, but also inspired many new ideas.

After I graduated from the Ph.D. program, I joined the Amazon cloud computing department to make it easier for more people to use deep learning. I was exposed to a lot of young students and engineers at work, who were all eager to learn about deep learning and wanted to apply it to their work and research. I was often asked how to learn deep learning. I found that the textbooks I knew were either too academic (such as focusing on mathematical algorithm descriptions) or too practical (such as introducing how to use a deep learning framework). The ideal textbook in my mind should be a good balance between algorithms and practice.

One night in September 2017, I suddenly came up with an idea to produce a tutorial by myself, hoping everyone could benefit by avoiding the extra effort I had to endure. I wanted to create a Jupyter notepad for each algorithm, first describing it mathematically, then providing its implementation, and finally giving examples of using it on real data. Whether it is an algorithm or practice, everyone can fulfill their needs.

At the beginning, I modified the tutorial that Zack wrote for Apache MXNet, translated it into Chinese, and then taught everyone about it every Saturday during live broadcasts by Jiangmen Venture Capital. Soon, I was running out of content by Zack, and I had to write new content myself. Fortunately, Aston joined the project and took over most of the work. This weekly online lecture lasted for five months, during which nearly 3,000 students participated in the discussion and contributed nearly 5,000 valuable discussion topics. In particular, several of the exercises in the actual competition were very popular.

The popularity of this course was beyond our expectations. We guessed maybe more people would become interested in this tutorial that combines algorithms and practice. So, in the next seven months, we almost rewrote each section to improve their accuracy and readability. From the beginning of this project, we made all the materials available online, allowing everyone to download and distribute them freely. But we also think that publishing them into a paper book may allow more people to know about it. At least, I personally prefer paper books, so we requested People's Posts and Telecommunications Press to be in charge of publishing. Our original intention was to make it easier for more people to use deep learning, so in order to make it easy for everyone to access these resources, we retained a free version online and lowered the price of paper book by not charging a publishing fee.

It is true that the integration of algorithms, formulas, pictures, codes, and examples into a book that is suitable for reading, and a series of notebooks with interactive experiences, was a great challenge for us. Please forgive the inevitable negligence in the book, which might be a lot, and I hope that you can report the problems to us through the QR code at the end of each section.

Finally, let me attach a poem by Lu You as encouragement:

> “What's learned from books are superficial, after all. It's crucial to have it personally tested by practice.”
